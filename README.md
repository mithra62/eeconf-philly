# EEConf Phily 2022 Files
Project files for my EEConf talk [ExpressionEngine, Artificial Intelligence, and Matchmaking; a Workshop](https://www.eeconf.com/events/eeconf-2022-fall-summit). While it's not required that everything's up and working, we will be reviewing some of the files here in details during the talk. It's advised to clone this repo or, at the least, use GitHub to follow along. 

## Requirements

There's some Python work in here, which require Python 3.6 at the least. This is installed on most systems by default though most of the included code is using the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) distrobution

It's also highly recommended (though not at all required) to use a Python Virtual Environment. 

## Installation

Assuming you have Python 3 installed, just run the below within the `predict` directory
```cmd
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Note that there are NO included datasets with this repo outside of what's included with the dependancies.

## Notes

1. Remain calm; it's not scary
2. Python is a really fun programming language
3. PHP machine learning is a long way off 
4. You're gonna do great :)
